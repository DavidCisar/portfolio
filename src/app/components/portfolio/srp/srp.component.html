      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p style="text-align: justify"><br>
        Having success in finding suitable sponsoring partnerships highly depends on
        the ability to communicate with companies that are willing to provide sponsorship and are not feasible without
        these existing contacts to individuals in positions of responsibility.
        <br><br>
        Sponsor-RING is a platform that helps to match clubs seeking funding and companies to work out a perfect fit,
        consisting of an attractive solution package for both involved entities. Sponsor-RING is a startup, which emerged
        from a business plan competition of the University of Bayreuth and is managed by a mix of students and professionals.
        <br><br>
        The development process followed a dedicated and iterative software development cycle: Elaboration of the requirements,
        Entity-Relationship-models, UI-Mocking, Software Development, Team Reviews and Testing (Unit & E2E Testing).
        <br><br>
        The platform is a classic full-stack project utilizing a single-page application build in Angular as the frontend
        that communicates with RESTful API-Endpoints build with Spring in the backend. As a database, weâ€™re using a PostgreSQL database.
        Access to dedicated parts of the application is restricted and secured with JWT.
